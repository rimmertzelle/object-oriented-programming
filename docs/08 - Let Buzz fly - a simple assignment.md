**Step 1 - Class representation of Buzz**

Create a class representation of Buzz Lightyear. Do not forget to add a game class as well. The game class is responsible for event handling en collision detection (added in step 3).

**Step 2 - add some movement to Buzz**

When you hit the spacebar Buzz must fly / jump at least 100px

**Step 3 - add some collision detection**

Create a coin above Buzz his head. When buzz jumps and hits the coin the coin should dissapear.
